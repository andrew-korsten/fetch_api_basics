# fetch_api_basics
I created this project based on the video from Traversy Media on API fetch basics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=13). 

# Purpose

I just monkey-code through the examples from the video and make the comments based on them. I plan to reuse this project for years to come whenever I need to remember some 
specific detail regarding Fetch API.
